# Lina's Calculator

Blessed with a variety of leftover parts from my recent mechanical keyboard
building, I set out to build a personalized calculator for my daughter.  It
is intended to help reinforce math facts as she works through her elementary
math work while also providing a tool for deeper learning of engineering and
programming principles.

I modified Victor Lucachi's [VOID16](https://github.com/victorlucachi/void16)
model, and used a Seeed Xaio RP2040 board w/ a 128x64 OLED display and 
hand-wired 4x4 keypad matrix.  A small lipo provides portable operation.

Kicking off this repo with the couple-of-afternoons work on an initial,
functional calculator firmware in micropython...

Will hope to expand this in future to include some math games, too.
